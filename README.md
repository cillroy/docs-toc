An extension to launch your Table of Contents in a web based visualizer.

`Ctrl+D Ctrl+T` will launch the Table of Contents Visualizer, with the content from your open file.

You will need to have a valid Table of Contents file open, for this extension to work.

If your document language is anything other than `markdown`, the extension will assume it is `yaml`.
